# Titanic-Survival-Rate-ML

Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning Analysis)

Machine learning analysis of the Titanic dataset to understand which passenger characteristics influenced survival and to build a predictive model.

This project is presented as a research-style Jupyter Notebook.

⸻

## Project Objective

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using passenger attributes such as age, sex, ticket class, and fare.

We focus on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Comparison
- Model Evaluation & Interpretation

## Dataset

[Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the project root directory.

## Key Findings
- **Sex** was the strongest predictor — women survived at 74% vs. men at 19%
- **Passenger class** significantly influenced survival — 63% in 1st class vs. 24% in 3rd
- **Title** extracted from passenger names captured social status and ranked among the top features
- **Gradient Boosting** outperformed Logistic Regression and Random Forest across 5-fold cross-validation

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
