🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning Analysis)

Machine learning analysis of the Titanic dataset to understand which passenger characteristics influenced survival and to build a predictive model.

This project is presented as a research-style Jupyter Notebook.

⸻

Project Objective

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using passenger attributes such as age, sex, ticket class, and fare.

We focus on:
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis
	•	Feature Engineering
	•	Model Training
	•	Model Evaluation & Interpretation

Key Findings
	•	Gender was the strongest predictor of survival
	•	Higher passenger class significantly increased survival probability
	•	Family size had moderate impact
	•	Machine learning captured non-linear relationships between features
